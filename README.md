📊 Adventure Works Sales & Profit Dashboard

This project presents an end-to-end business intelligence dashboard developed for Adventure Works Cycles to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and product trends across regions and time periods.

The dashboard consolidates key business metrics such as total sales, profit, production cost, tax paid, total customers, and order volume into a single interactive view. With $29.36M in total sales and $12.08M in total profit, the report highlights overall business health while enabling deeper drill-downs by product category, country, customer, and month.
